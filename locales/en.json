    "first-part-of-text": "from 1969 to 1973, engineers Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie from the American company Bell Labs worked on this. Before that, high-level programming languages were very limited and didn't allow for many things that have become common today. Developers had to write many functions in assembly language or at the machine code level. This approach slowed down development and required deep knowledge of how the hardware worked.",
    "second-part-of-text": "According to one legend, Ritchie had a favorite computer game that he used to run on the companyâ€™s server. He wanted to transfer the game to his personal workstation, but it didn't have an operating system. As a result, he decided to rewrite the existing OS, which was entirely written in assembly language, using the high-level language B. However, it turned out that B's capabilities were insufficient to fully utilize the computer's features, so it was decided to create a new programming language. This is how C was born.",
    "third-part-of-text": "The C language became popular primarily due to its widespread use in the UNIX operating system, on which Linux distributions are based.",
